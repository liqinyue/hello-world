# hello-world
My 1st repository

Hi everyone!
I'm a college school student major in computer science. 
My dream is to creat AI with human intelligence.
Up till now, I've learnt a little Java, as well as C.
And all my programming exps are simple schoolworks.
In general, I'm a novice. I hope to learn more here, in Github.
Let's have fun together!
